# Concept Base Specification

## Overview
This document specifies the structure and operations of a concept base system designed for logical reasoning and algebraic operations over concepts and their relationships.

## Core Components

### 1. Concepts
A concept is the fundamental unit in our system. Each concept represents a distinct idea, entity, or category. Concepts can be:
- Concrete entities (e.g., "Black Beauty")
- Categories (e.g., "Horse", "Mammal")
- Abstract ideas (e.g., "Speed", "Intelligence")

### 2. Relationships
Relationships connect concepts to each other. The primary relationship types are:

#### 2.1 IS-A Relationship
- Represents hierarchical classification
- Transitive: If A IS-A B and B IS-A C, then A IS-A C
- Properties:
  - Source Concept
  - Target Concept
  - Relationship Type (IS-A)
  - Provenance (how we know this relationship):
    - Direct assertion
    - Logical deduction (with references to premises)
    - External reference/source

### 3. Logical Inference System
The system maintains both explicit and derived relationships:
- Explicit relationships are directly asserted
- Derived relationships are computed through logical inference
- Each derived relationship maintains references to its premises
- Example:
  ```
  Explicit: Black Beauty IS-A Horse
  Explicit: Horse IS-A Mammal
  Derived: Black Beauty IS-A Mammal (premises: above two relationships)
  ```

## Questions for Discussion
1. Should we support relationship types beyond IS-A? (e.g., HAS-A, PART-OF)
2. How should we handle conflicting information or exceptions?
3. Should concepts have properties/attributes beyond their relationships?
4. How should we represent and handle uncertainty in relationships?
5. Should we support different types of logical reasoning beyond transitive inference?

## Next Steps
1. Define the complete set of relationship types
2. Specify the logical inference rules
3. Design the data structure for storing concepts and relationships
4. Define the API for adding, querying, and manipulating concepts
